# Rainfall Intensity prediction 
This project aims to predict the rainfall intensity using three machine learning models: Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest, and Decision Tree.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the [Cleaned Weather Dataset for Uganda
](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/PQLYHP).
